You are writing Go code following the guidelines in [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)

- Use clear and simple declarations.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid unnecessary parentheses.
- Format all code using `gofmt`.
- Write comments only where necessary, but always document exported names.
- Use `MixedCaps` for function and variable names.
- Use `defer` for resource cleanup.
- Favor receiver methods with pointer receivers unless a value receiver is explicitly needed.
- Keep functions short and focused.
- Return errors explicitly instead of panicking.
