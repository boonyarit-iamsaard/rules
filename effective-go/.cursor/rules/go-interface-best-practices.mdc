description: Use interfaces effectively in Go.
---

Interfaces are central to Go's design. Follow these best practices:

- Define small interfaces (preferably one or two methods)
- Let types implement interfaces implicitlyâ€”no need for `implements`
- Use interface embedding to compose behavior
- Accept interfaces, return structs
- Use empty interface (`interface{}`) only when absolutely necessary
- Prefer concrete types unless abstraction is required
- Example:

  ```go
  type Stringer interface {
      String() string
  }
