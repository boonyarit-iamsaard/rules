Use the following naming conventions in Go:

- **Packages**: lowercase, singular (e.g., `bytes`, `fmt`, `os`)
- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase` (also known as `MixedCaps`)
- **Constants**: use `UPPER_CASE` if they're unexported; otherwise, `CamelCase` if exported
- **Interfaces**: single method interface named `<Method>er` (e.g., `io.Reader`, `http.Handler`)
- **Getters**: name as `Owner()` instead of `GetOwner()`
- **Receiver Names**: short and consistent (e.g., `r` for Reader, `w` for Writer)
- **Function Names**: should clearly state intent (e.g., `NewServer`, `ValidateRequest`)
